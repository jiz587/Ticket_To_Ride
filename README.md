# Ticket_To_Ride

This project is for Assignment 4 IS545. I have constructred a map with the cities in the game "Ticket-To-Ride". When each player places their train on route, the route
and points would be added to data. All graphs would display  with four colors where each color represents a player. The lines on the map shows which route the players
claimed. The bar graph shows the current score board of the gamestate, and the line chart shows the progression of the points by rounds.
